redditdesktop
=============

A small utility to download wallpapers from reddit. Nothing novel, just a way for me to learn some python. If you want an actual tool to get wallpapers from reddit, try http://www.reddit.com/r/wallpapers/comments/1t1zcf/its_finally_here_the_thing_nobodys_been_asking/. You probably shouldn't be using this one.


Installation
------------
For now, a few steps are required to run:
* Setup a scheduled task to run redditdesktop.py on the interval where you want to sync wallpapers
* Setup windows to run the desktop as a slideshow from C:\Users\m01613\Pictures (this will be configurable in the future)
